NAME
    POE::Loop::EV - a bridge that supports EV from POE

SYNOPSIS
        use EV;
        use POE;
    
        ...
    
        POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop interface. It
    follows POE::Loop's public interface exactly. Therefore, please see
    POE::Loop for its documentation.

CAVEATS
    Certain EV backends do not support polling on normal filehandles, namely
    epoll and kqueue. You should avoid using regular filehandles with
    select_read, select_write, ReadWrite, etc.

SEE ALSO
